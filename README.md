This project aims to predict how many runs a batsman will score in a cricket match using machine learning techniques. The dataset, uploaded in Excel format, consists of ball-by-ball data from cricket matches, including features like the batting team, bowling team, over, ball, batsman, and runs scored. Various models like Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and XGBoost were used to make predictions. The performance of these models was evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²). Future improvements could include adding more features, using sequential models, and improving predictions on new, unseen data.
